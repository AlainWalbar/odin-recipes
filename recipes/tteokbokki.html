    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is made with rice cakes (garaetteok, cylinder-shaped rice cake), fish cakes, boiled egg, and seasoned with chile paste. The rice cakes are chewy and tender. It looks super spicy and, originally, it is! But you can control the amount of chile paste. You might be able to find it easily at food vendors on the street of Korea. There are always delicious dukbokki boiling and ready to go. Garnish with sesame seeds if you like.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>It's quite spicy. So check the taste when you add the sauce so that you can control the amount of heat.</p>
    <p>If you use frozen rice cakes, just defrost them in the microwave for 30 seconds. Don't boil the rice cakes for too long, otherwise they will be mushy.</p>
